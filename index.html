                <li>
                    Born and raised in São José, not the one in Silicon Valley, São José
                    dos Campos, a medium size town near São Paulo in Brazil, a pole in the
                    aeronautic industry, but airplanes never were my thing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Since I was a child, I had contact with computers - my dad was a programer as well, but he worked in the area just for a while. Due to
                    that, just like the majority of computer scientist, I was amazed with what we could do with a computer, and of course wanted to be a game
                    developer. Maybe one day...
                </li>
                <li>
                    With all that said, must look like I always wanted to work with this
                    beautiful machines, but that is not actually true, I even thought in
                    get a degree in psychology, during my high school - in Brazil we decide our major before we get into college, it's a little bit controverse, but that how it is - I still have a lot of interest in
                    the area, no wonder one of the areas that I want to learn the most in
                    cs is AI and Marchine Learning.
                </li>
                <li>But who knows, I'm still in the beggining of this journey...</li>
